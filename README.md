# BenhamsDisk

# Project Description
This is an optical illusion that uses a 'spinning' black and white disk to make your mind think it's seeing color.
Any and all colors that you may see are in your own mind and do not appear on the screen. 
This is linked to education work I used to do at the Exploratorium and is a combination of different exhibits that I worked with.
The intent is to explore creating some new interactive virtual education tools.

# Tools
You can change the amount of arcs that appear on the page, the speed at which the disk rotates, and its direction. 
Different speeds affect users in different ways, and some people may not even see color at all! 

# Notable mentions
This project was built using Phaser 3, and was presented at WaffleJS in May 2020. It is also featured on the Exploratorium webpage at <https://www.exploratorium.edu/exhibits/benhams-disk>
